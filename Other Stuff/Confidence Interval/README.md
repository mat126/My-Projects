# Confidence Intervals and Marsaglia Algorithm

### Description

This project involves various exercises on confidence intervals, focusing on how they vary depending on the sample size and the distribution of the data. The analysis is accompanied by visualizations that illustrate the differences and behaviors of confidence intervals. Additionally, the project includes an explanation of the Marsaglia algorithm.

### Key Concepts

- Construction and interpretation of confidence intervals
- Visualization of how intervals change with different sample sizes and distributions
- Exploration of the Marsaglia algorithm, including its purpose and implementation
