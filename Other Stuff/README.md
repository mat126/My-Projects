# Other Coding and Statistical Projects

This folder contains smaller projects and exercises that don't rely on specific datasets. These include coding exercises, algorithm implementations, and explorations of statistical concepts.

### Projects

1. **Bisection Method**
   - Implementation of an algorithm to find specific percentiles in a normal distribution using the bisection method.

2. **Confidence Intervals and Marsaglia Algorithm**
   - Various exercises exploring confidence intervals, their variations, and an in-depth explanation of the Marsaglia algorithm.

These projects demonstrate specific techniques and ideas that can be useful in data science and programming.
