# Bisection Method Algorithm

### Description

This project demonstrates an implementation of the bisection method, an iterative algorithm used to find specific percentiles in a normal distribution. The algorithm efficiently narrows down the range to converge on the desired value.

### Key Concepts

- Understanding of the bisection method and its application
- Practical use of algorithms to find percentiles in probability distributions
- Numerical analysis techniques in R
