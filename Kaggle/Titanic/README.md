# Titanic Survival Prediction

### Description

This project focuses on a predictive analysis of the Titanic dataset available on Kaggle. The goal was to explore various classification models to predict the survival of passengers based on features such as age, gender, class, and more. After comparing multiple models, the best-performing classifier was selected.

### Key Steps

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand key features
- Implementation and comparison of multiple classification models, including:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Evaluation of models using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall
- Selection of the best model based on performance metrics
