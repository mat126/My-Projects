# My Projects

Welcome to the **My Projects** repository!

This repository is a collection of various projects focused on statistics. The projects here cover a range of statistical topics, from pure data analysis and predictive modeling to visual representations of data. Some of these projects were developed as part of my university coursework, while others are personal experiments and explorations.

While these projects might not be groundbreaking, they represent my journey of learning and applying statistical concepts, techniques, and tools. Each project has helped me improve my skills in data analysis, forecasting, and data visualization, and I hope you might find them insightful or useful.

**Note**: The more significant projects will have their own dedicated repositories, which will be linked from here. This way, you can explore them in more detail if you're interested.

Feel free to explore the repository, and if you have any suggestions or ideas for improvement, I would love to hear from you!
