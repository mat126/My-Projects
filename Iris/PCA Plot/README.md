# PCA Plot and Clustering on Iris Dataset

### Description

This project applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to the Iris dataset, reducing the dimensionality and visualizing the data on the first two principal components. Using these components, a clustering approach is applied by enclosing the data points in ellipses, providing a visual representation of the groups.

### Key Steps

- Performing PCA to reduce the dataset to two principal components
- Visualizing the distribution of data points on the new components
- Applying a clustering approach by enclosing data points within ellipses
